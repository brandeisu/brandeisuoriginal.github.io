	<h1>Serivces and Outreach Committee</h1>
	Alison Zheng and Mary Michalos are the Committee chairs of the Services and Outreach Committee:
	This semester our goal is to develop a Twitter, Facebook and Instagram account that the Student Union can update students of the events and initiatives we are working on. Another goal is to plan another successful midnight buffet for the students with the initiative to make it a less chaotic event and T-shirts more available!
	Mary's office hours are Thursday 4:30pm-6:30pm in the Student Union Office.
