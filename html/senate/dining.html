	<h1>Dining Committee</h1>
	The Senate Dining Committee is the means through which student voices can be appropriately heard by both the Brandeis administration, and by Sodexo. The concerns, suggestions, and ideas of actual students are at the forefront of our work, and we always have student's interests at heart when performing our duties. This past semester has proven to be one of the most transparent, productive, and positive semesters for the committee. We have increased dialogue with the administration, have hosted public events for students to directly raise their concerns, and have made a lot of progress with dining services. We're looking forward to finishing this year off with an amazing semester!
	<br />~Ben Margolin, Chair

	<h1>Getting Involved</h1>
	We encourage students to continue posting on our facebook group, and reaching out to us when the have a comment or concern. Moreover, we have a few non-Senate positions available on the committee, for which we will be accepting applications very soon! If anyone would like to meet with me, please reach out and I'd love to hear what you have to say.
