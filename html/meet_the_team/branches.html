	<h1>Union Branches</h1>
	Knowing your Student Union is important in voicing yourself, beginning a new initiative, or showing interest in becoming a member, and absolutely essential in club creation, management, and financing. Which senators represent your class and residential hall? Who can you speak to about making a new club? Senate committees also represent several causes such as dining and sustainability, and meet regularly with faculty on these topics and issues.
	<br />The Union has three major branches: the Executive Board, and the Allocations Board. The Treasury functions closely with A-board, the Judiciary functions independently, and various Union representatives and Deis Day coordinators attend E-board meetings.
	Each has rights and responsibilities as set forth by the Constitution. 
	<br />The Constitution has twelve articles: Supremacy, <b>Union Senate, Union Executive Board, Student Judiciary, Allocations Board, Union Clubs, Union Finances, Union Representation, Union Elections </b>, Removal from Office, Amendments, Constitutional Review.
