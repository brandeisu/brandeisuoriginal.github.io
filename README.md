Why GitHub?
The Student Union has a history of creating new sites every few years and asking LTS NetSys to reroute to the new website.
GitHub has several benefits that make it more agreeable and therefore less likely to be dropped:
1) it's a free web host.
2) the common account can be passed on easily.
3) most web developers already know how to use it.
4) future members can forward the home page if they so wish to a new site, without needing to bother LTS NetSys for DNS rerouting.
5) as a revision control service, it guarantees back-ups and hosting reliability.
